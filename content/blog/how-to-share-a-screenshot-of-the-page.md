This page is about the elephant in the brain. It is so cool dude. You're brain is tricking you and you don't even realise it. Fool yourself to better fool others. Every person has an outward reason and a hidden motive. Isn't that crazy cool. I can't believe that I have been lying to myself all this time. It's crazy. The cortex and the frontal lobe work interstingly. There was an interesting experiment with the left and right hemispheres of the brain outlined in the book.
